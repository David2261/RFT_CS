*Rocket fuel and trajectory computing system*


## Are you sure I'm not coming to your house?
*My project is based on computations: rocket fuel according to Tsiolkovsky formulas, numerical simulation 
of rocket flight, models of the moment of the drag force, etc.*

## The theoretical part
- Calculations
*All formulas and calculations can be found in the folder .idea/theory/img*

- Links to information
*You can find all the source in the file: .idea/theory/source.md*
